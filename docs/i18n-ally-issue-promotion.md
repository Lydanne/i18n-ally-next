# 🚀 i18n Ally Next — A Maintained Fork with New Features & Full Documentation

Hi everyone 👋

As a long-time user of i18n Ally, I've benefited greatly from this amazing extension. However, since the original project has slowed down in maintenance, many community issues and PRs remain unresolved, and support for newer frameworks is lagging behind.

That's why I created **[i18n Ally Next](https://github.com/lydanne/i18n-ally-next)** — a maintained fork that preserves all the classic features you love, while adding new capabilities and **a complete documentation site**.

## What's New?

### 🤖 More Translation Engines
- **Editor LLM** — Use your editor's built-in AI (GitHub Copilot, etc.) for translation. Zero config, zero API keys.
- **Ollama** — Fully offline translation using local LLMs. Perfect for data-sensitive environments.
- Plus the existing engines: Google, DeepL, OpenAI, Baidu, LibreTranslate.

### 📋 Review System
- Review translations one by one — approve, reject, or leave comments.
- Save machine translations as **candidates** for team review before applying.
- Review data stored as YAML in your project — fully version-controllable.

### 🔍 Stale Translation Detection
- Detects when source language text changes but translations haven't been updated.
- Offers one-click retranslation or one-by-one review of stale entries.

### 🔎 Project-wide Scan & Extract
- Scan your entire project for hard-coded strings in one command.
- Batch extract with auto-generated keys — great for i18n migration of existing projects.

### 🖥️ Visual Translation Editor
- Built-in Webview editor panel for a more intuitive editing experience.
- Side-by-side multi-language view, inline editing, review integration.

### 📊 Usage Report & Key Management
- Analyze key usage: active, idle, and missing keys.
- Duplicate keys, fulfill missing keys, mark keys as in-use.

### 📖 Complete Documentation
- **Full documentation site**: [https://lydanne.github.io/i18n-ally-next/](https://lydanne.github.io/i18n-ally-next/)
- Guides for every feature, framework-specific best practices, configuration reference.
- Available in **English** and **中文**.
